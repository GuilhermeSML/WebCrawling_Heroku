     Marketing practices in the UK small business sector
 |  Emerald Insight, https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02634500210414774/full/html, In the UK, some 95 per cent of firms are considered small businesses. Although there is a general agreement in the literature that a market oriented firm is one in which all employees are committed to the continuous creation of superior value for the customer, what is not clear is whether the market orientation concept is appreciated by the small business owner. A postal survey is conducted among owner‐managers aimed at assessing marketing practices within the UK small business sector. The results identify three key strategies (management/staff relationship, profitability and changing markets) employed by owner‐managers. Conclusions, managerial implications and future research directions are discussed.
Measures of Marketing Success:: A Comparison Between Spain and the UK - ScienceDirectScienceDirect, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263237302000646, IntroductionSection snippetsReferences (34)Cited by (16)Despite the importance of assessing business performance, there is little research on the measures used to evaluate marketing effectiveness. This paper replicates in Spain some UK research into the relative importance of categories of marketing metrics, e.g. financial and non-financial, customer and competitive. The Spanish results are compared with those from the UK. In Spain, respondents saw financial metrics as less important than their UK counterparts and they appeared to be more marketing oriented. In both countries the importance given to metrics categories were consistent with orientation. Marketing assets appear to be more regularly tracked in Spain than in the UK. In Spain performance metrics are mostly compared with the previous year whereas in the UK the marketing plan is the principal benchmark. Spanish managers are more satisfied with the metrics they use to assess marketing performance although both see considerable room for improvement.
     Using the 7Ps as a generic marketing mix: an exploratory survey
of UK and European marketing academics
 |  Emerald Insight, https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02634509510097793?src=recsys/full/html, McCarthy′s 4Ps mix has increasingly come under attack with the
result that different marketing mixes have been put forward for
different marketing contexts. Contends that the numerous and ad hoc conceptualizations undermine the concept of the marketing mix and
proposes that Booms and Bitner′s (1981) 7Ps mix for services be extended
to other areas of marketing. Shows how the 7Ps framework can be applied
to consumer goods and reports the results of a survey of UK and European
marketing academics which suggest that there is a high degree of
dissatisfaction with 4Ps. Also suggests that the 7Ps framework has
already achieved a high degree of acceptance as a generic
marketing mix among both groups of respondents. Overall provides fairly
strong support for the view that Booms and Bitner′s 7Ps framework should
replace McCarthy′s 4Ps framework.
     International marketing of British education: research on the students’ perception and the UK market penetration
 |  Emerald Insight, https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02634500310490265/full/html, The study functions as marketing intelligence inputs for the UK Government, the British Council as well as academic marketing planners for constructing their marketing opportunities‐threats audits, it investigates international students’ perception about the UK education and it researches UK performance in the world markets for international education. UK education has been known to be the best in the world. For many years, the UK universities have enjoyed a high reputation and have benefited in accelerating its market penetration worldwide. Unfortunately, this superiority has begun to decline. Other countries are strongly emerging with their quality education. The study shows that UK competitors achieved a remarkable growth of their international students’ enrolment while the UK achieves only a marginal growth with declining market penetration abroad. The findings confirmed the central importance of pricing, product and promotional variables in designing and marketing UK education abroad.
     The current use of marketing in UK retailing
 |  Emerald Insight, https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09590550410534587/full/html, The UK retail environment is highly complex and competitive and as such the context for marketing may require change. This research investigates current marketing practices used by retail companies in the UK and explores their correlation across four different retail sectors. Random samples of companies from the grocery and convenience, specialist audio‐photographic and IT, retail banking and financial services, and, the optical, health, hair and beauty services sectors were used. Across all sectors, respondents feel that their company's marketing practices are changing to become increasingly focussed on a relationship with the customer. No evidence was found of a difference between the marketing variables by industry sector, nor that certain marketing practices might be more prevalent in specific industry sectors. Correlation analysis also shows that a variety of marketing types are being practised simultaneously across all retail companies.
     The marketing strategies of universities in the United Kingdom
 |  Emerald Insight, https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09513549910269485/full/html, Universities in the UK are facing huge changes to their environment, in terms of both supply of funding and level of demand for their courses. One of the most dramatic recent changes has been the alteration in status of the former polytechnics to fully fledged universities. In order to find out how both old and new universities are responding to this rapidly changing environment, we sent questionnaires to a number of senior staff. Based on 131 responses (81 from old universities, 50 from new), we have been able to paint a picture of how marketing is undertaken in these two segments. We report on how these institutions perceive their marketing task, and also the extent to which these two traditionally different sectors agree on the role marketing plays in their sector. Our research clearly indicates these two groups of institutions have fundamentally different approaches to operationalising their marketing strategies.
